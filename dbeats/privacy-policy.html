  <p></p>
  <h6>3- Subscriptions</h6>
  Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription(s)”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing
  Cycle”). Billing cycles are set on a monthly basis. At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same
  conditions unless you cancel it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal by following the procedures outlined by Play Store.

  billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial. If you agree to begin a Free Trial, you will not be charged until the Free Trial has expired. On
  the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you canceled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type
  of Subscription you have selected. At any time and without notice, Diego Cavalcanti reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free
  Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.
  <p></p>
  <h6>5-Changes</h6>
  We reserve the right to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms
  taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.
